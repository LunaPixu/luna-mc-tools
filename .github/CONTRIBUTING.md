## How to contribute to Luna MCT
Thanks for taking the time to contribute to my little web app. I'm just a novice web dev, so please excuse the mess.  
If you haven't already, check the [README](./README.md) for info on the site (such as development, suggestions, etc.)
### Reporting bugs
When it comes to reporting bugs, please keep these in mind:
* As with most projects, please check the Issues section on the Github repo to see if the bug has already been reported.
* Unless your issue relates to something outside of incognito mode (like cookies), try running the site in incognito mode.
* Try disabling as many browser extensions as you can. Doing so helps narrow down whether the issue is from a browser extension or Luna MCT itself.
* Bugs encountered only in static builds of Luna MCT will be ignored for the time being unless they can be proven to be present on the live website, preview deployments, or local full builds in some capacity.
* When making a report, please provide as much info regarding your bug as possible. I'd greatly appreciate it if you provide some of the following in your report:
  * Your browser (and browser version)
  * The exact data/settings you input into a given tool
  * Any browser console logs (`Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+J` on Chrome/Chromium browsers and Firefox)
* Please also detail expected behaviours regarding your bug and any steps to reproduce it.
* Please be patient when waiting for fixes. At the time of writing, Luna MCT is just one novice's little side project. Fixes may be slow while I try to figure out how to fix things. 

### Contributing tools/features
When adding features of your own, please consult the [Suggesting section](./README.md/#suggesting-featurestools) of the README before proceeding.  
*As a reminder, any features from [misode](https://misode.github.io) or [MCStacker](https://mcstacker.net) will be immediately rejected.*

I prefer to be notified before significant progress on a feature has been made. Please reach out to me on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/luna_pixu/) or post your idea in the Issues section with the Enhancement label.  
Then, when you're ready to submit your additions, create a Github Pull Request detailing your feature in full. This will help me understand any changes you may have made to pre-existing code/assets and also the full scope of your feature.
### Fixing bugs
Thank you so much for taking the time to help fix issues.  
If you do have a fix for any issue on our list, please open a Github Pull Request with your fix and explain any details regarding the fix. I'd greatly appreciate any insight you might have on what went wrong. Please be sure to link to or reference any related bugs that have been reported on the Issues tab.
